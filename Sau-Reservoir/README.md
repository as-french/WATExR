#Sau Reservoir description

The Sau Reservoir is located in the North-East of Spain near Barcelona.
The reservoir is on the middle stretch of the Ter river catchment and 
is the main water input for the downstream Susqueda Reservoir, which is
the main water withdrawal source for treatment and human consumption for 
Barcelona metropolitan area . The main purposes of the chain of reservoirs
are water supply, flood protection and recreation.

The canyon-like reservoir is characterized as eutrophic and monomictic,
mainly stratified from March to November-December. It receives water from 
a mix of land cover types including: densely populated areas, productive 
pastures and agricultural activities in the lowlands and natural forest 
dominates in the high part of the catchment, for a total area of 1523 km2.
The water level suffers wide fluctuations, with maximum in May and minimum 
in September.  Severe drawdowns or increases in Sau Reservoir often induce 
water quality deteriorations episodes and can even give rise to cyanobacterial 
blooms or to increase the dissolved organic carbon making the reservoir sensitive
to both droughts and floods.

Characteristics of Sau Reservoir:

Altitude bottom: 384.6 m.
Surface area (Full capacity): 580 ha
Volume (Full capacity): 168 hm3
Retention time: 0.2 years
Mean depth: 40 m
Maximum depth: 75 m
Mixing regime: monomictic

Management issues:
1. High concentration of dissolved organic carbon during extreme events
2. Low levels of water under drought condition obliging the use of complex
water treatment (e. g., active carbon).
3. Occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms during hot summers.

Work Flow: 
The main concept for an integrated modeling of the system and a management tool 
for the stakeholder can be summarized by:

1. Coupling the catchment model with the lake model.
2. Establishing a workflow that uses meteorological data provided by weather and 
climate services for driving both of the catchment and the lake. 
3. The catchment model provides the lake model with inflow data. The catchment
and reservoir coupling includes mHM as hydrological model and GOTM as lake model. 
4. The outflow leaving both Sau and Susqueda reservoirs is regulated by a multi-gate
withdrawal structure that allows taking water at different depths, which is used by
the water managers to control water quantity and quality in the chain of reservoirs.
Such a set of operational conditions and their changes for certain scenarios are 
simulated according to historical data provided by the stakeholders.
5. The lake model (GOTM) is one dimensional and it simulates vertical turbulent fluxes
of momentum, heat and dissolved and particulate matter.
